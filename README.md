# Platform Jumper!

Don't touch the ground, and don't stand still for too long!

This is a very simple platform jumping game I built over a weekend when I was learning how to manipulate the DOM. Just straight vanilla JS, baby.

I hope to build it out more someday, maybe adding enemies that try to track you down or something.

I wrote a short blog post about how I added gravity to the game: https://decodingdavid.wordpress.com/2017/11/08/adding-gravity-to-a-two-dimensional-game-in-javascript/
